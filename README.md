Learning how to structure a CNN through Keras-Tensorflow with DeepLizard

Using Keras-TensoFlow I was able to build a model with 99% accuracy with predicting cats vs dogs using a dataset of 1000 Pics (500 dog, 500 cat)
# Key Learnings
Data pre-processing
Learnt the use cases for different hidden layers (Dence, Flatten, Conv2D, MaxPool2D)
Used the VGG16 model
Image augmentation using ImageDataGenerator
How to tune hyperperamiters of VGG16 model.
